# lololib - Cross-platform utilities library for C 🛠
## Usage ⚙️
In the `template/` folder, you can see how to use the library to build a binary.<br />
You can also use the library in your project by adding the following lines to your `CMakeLists.txt`:
```cmake
include(FetchContent)
FetchContent_Declare(
    lololib
    GIT_REPOSITORY "https://github.com/Lqvrent/lololib.git"
    GIT_TAG "1.0.0" # can be a branch, a tag or a commit
)
FetchContent_MakeAvailable(lololib)
target_link_libraries(${PROJECT_NAME} lolo)
target_include_directories(${PROJECT_NAME} PRIVATE ${lololib_SOURCE_DIR}/includes)
```
## Documentation 📚
You can find the documentation [here](https://lqvrent.github.io/lololib/). <br />
You can also build it locally (with Doxygen) by running the following commands :
```bash
mkdir build && cd build
cmake -DBUILD_WITH_DOCS=ON ..
make docs # or mingw32-make docs, depending if you're on Windows
```
